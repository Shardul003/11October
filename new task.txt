This project is about building a multi-agent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can read two PDFs, understand them, and answer user questions with very high accuracy.

Unlike normal PDF-QA chatbots that use a single agent, this system uses five coordinated AI agents, all connected using LangGraph, to ensure structured reasoning and minimal hallucination.

🚀 What the Project Does

Takes two PDFs from the user

The PDFs are converted into text.

Text is chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database.

When a user asks a question, the system activates five agents, each doing a specific job:

🧠 The 5 AI Agents
1️⃣ Query Refiner Agent

Cleans, rewrites, and clarifies the user's raw question.

Removes ambiguity and turns it into a high-quality search query.

Goal: Make sure the system always retrieves the right information.

2️⃣ Document Retriever Agent

Searches both PDFs.

Fetches the most relevant text chunks using embeddings.

Goal: Bring only the important parts from the documents.

3️⃣ Chunk Summarizer Agent

Summarizes each retrieved chunk.

Converts long text into short, meaningful summaries.

Goal: Create compact, information-dense notes for the next agent.

4️⃣ Answer Synthesizer Agent

Takes all summaries and combines them.

Creates a final, well-structured answer.

Goal: Give a clean, complete, human-like response.

5️⃣ Hallucination Guard Agent

Double-checks the synthesized answer.

Validates whether the answer actually matches the PDFs.

Removes hallucinated or unsupported claims.

Goal: Ensure reliable, factual answers.

🔗 Why Use LangGraph?

LangGraph allows you to:

Build workflows with multiple agents connected in sequence

Define edges like:
Refiner → Retriever → Summarizer → Synthesizer → Guard

Control execution flow

Reduce hallucination

Make the system deterministic and explainable

This turns the chatbot into a pipeline with quality checks, instead of a single LLM guessing answers.

📈 Final Outcome

By the end of the project, you have:

✅ A multi-step RAG pipeline
✅ Five specialized agents
✅ A PDF-QA system with higher accuracy
✅ Structured, traceable reasoning
✅ A Streamlit UI powered by LangGraph
✅ A far more reliable chatbot than a standard one-agent RAG bot
