Subject: Request for Work Location Change on Medical Grounds

Dear Karan,

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to formally seek your guidance regarding a personal matter. When I joined the organization a few months ago, I was reporting to Rajkumar during my training period. As per the current reporting hierarchy, I understand that you are my senior manager, and hence I am reaching out to you for your kind consideration and direction. My assigned buddy, Madhuvani S, is also aware of my situation.

I am sincerely grateful for the opportunity to be part of the organization and for the recent project assignment. I remain fully committed to my role and to delivering my responsibilities with dedication and professionalism.

However, I am currently facing a significant family medical emergency. My mother was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s encephalopathy approximately a year ago. Despite continuous treatment, she continues to experience persistent symptoms such as tremors, confusion, and severe fatigue, which require regular monitoring and consistent support. Given the circumstances, my presence has become essential to ensure her well-being.

In light of this situation, I respectfully request a change in my current work location to Noida, Gurugram, or Delhi. This adjustment would enable me to support my family during this critical period while continuing to meet all work-related commitments. My father is currently working in Chandigarh, and my support is crucial at this time.

I would like to assure you that this request will not impact my availability, performance, or project deliverables. I remain fully focused on my assigned responsibilities and will ensure that all expectations are met without compromise.

I sincerely request your understanding and guidance in this matter. Please let me know if any documentation or additional information is required from my side, or if I should coordinate with any other stakeholders as per the process.

Thank you very much for your time and support.

Warm regards,
Shardul Badoni
